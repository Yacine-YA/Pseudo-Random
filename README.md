# Pseudo-Random


On a whim I asked myself the question about how randomness is integrated into an algorithm? 

So I started the adventure by trying to code a random and reliable function from scratch 

For the moment I found and code only one idea: 

-Use the time in nanoseconds and do a hack to randomize it (on a given interval (n,m))
