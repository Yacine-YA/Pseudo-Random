# Pseudo-Random


On a whim I asked myself the question about how randomness is integrated into an algorithm? 

So I started the adventure by trying to code a random and reliable function from scratch 

For the moment I found and code only two  idea: 

-I) Use nano-second timestamp

-II) Linear congruential generator (with time using)
